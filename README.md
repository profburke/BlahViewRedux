## README

BlahView.swift implements a dirt-simple subclass of UIView that I have occasionally found useful for
debugging and prototyping. To be honest, 99% of the time I've used this idea, I've used [Mark Dalrymple's](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/peek-a-view/)
original. The only reason this exists is that I wanted a Swift version for a particular project.

## Usage

Chuck everything except `BlahView.swift`. Copy it into your project. I'm not making a Podfile and since it's
not a dynamic framework, it's invisible/irrelevent as far as Carthage is concerned (I think).

## Future Development

There will almost certainly be no further development of this project&mdash;it's sufficient for my needs.
Post an issue and/or push request if you must, and I'll consider it.
